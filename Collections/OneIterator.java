/*
 The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface. 
 
 The Iterable interface defines the iterator method, which returns an iterator. 
 
 The Iterator interface provides a uniform way for traversing elements in various types of collections. 
 
 The iterator() method in the Iterable interface returns an instance of Iterator, which provides sequential access to the elements in the collection using the next() method. 
 
 You can also use the hasNext() method to check whether there are more elements in the iterator, and the remove() method to remove the last element returned by the iterator.
