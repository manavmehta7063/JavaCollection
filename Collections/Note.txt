The Java Collections Framework supports two types of containers:
 ■ One for storing a collection of elements is simply called a collection.
 ■ The other, for storing key/value pairs, is called a map. 

Maps are efficient data structures for quickly searching an element using a key.

Collections:
 ■ Sets store a group of nonduplicate elements.
 ■ Lists store an ordered collection of elements.
 ■ Stacks store objects that are processed in a last-in, first-out fashion.
 ■ Queues store objects that are processed in a first-in, first-out fashion.
 ■ PriorityQueues store objects that are processed in the order of their priorities.

The common features of these collections are defined in the interfaces, and implementations are provided in concrete classes. 

All the interfaces and classes defined in the Java Collections Framework are grouped in the java.util package.

---->ITERATOR<-----

Each collection is Iterable. 

You can obtain its Iterator object to traverse all the elements in the collection.

Iterator is a classic design pattern for walking through a data structure without having to expose the details of how data is stored in the data structure.
